1. Preemption vs. Cooperation

When we disabled preemption by setting `configUSE_PREEMPTION=0` in `FreeRTOSConfig.h`,
we noticed no difference. This is probably because all of our tasks have some `vTaskDelay`
calls in them, which transfers control to other tasks.

2. Time Slicing

When we ran with `configUSE_TIME_SLICING=0`, we noticed no difference
as well. We think that this is for the same reason (using `vTaskDelay` liberally).
While we do have some tasks which share the same priority, this use of delays lets
control transfer among them smoothly.

When we set the clock speed to 100MHz with `configCLOCK_RATE_MZ`, we noticed that
our click detection was no longer accurate. Frequently, double clicks were not
recognized, and were treated as two separate single clicks. This is likely
due to our use of external interrupts to implement debouncing and button handling,
where our thresholds for detecting types of clicks were no longer accurate with
respect to the new timing.
